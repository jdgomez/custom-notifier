# custom-notifier - agent instructions

Android app that alerts the user before a household consumable runs out. Built with agent engineering: agents write all the code, the owner approves and merges.

## Read first
- `docs/SESSION0.md` - what we are building: problem, scope, glossary, phases. **The glossary is the ubiquitous language: its terms are the type names.**
- `docs/WAYOFWORKING.md` - how we build it: roles, change lifecycle, definition of done, testing strategy, conventions. Changing it requires owner approval.

## Non-negotiables
- Every piece of work is an OpenSpec change: 1 change = 1 branch `change/<name>` = 1 PR = 1 squash commit on `main`, about 400 lines of production code at most.
- Conventional Commits everywhere. Never edit CHANGELOG or generated files by hand.
- Nothing reaches `main` without the no-mistakes gate and green CI. The owner merges; agents never do.
- Stop and escalate (do not improvise) when blocked, when the gate fails 3 times on the same change, or when a decision is not covered by the specs.
- Owner-only: new dependencies, UX approval, secrets, signing keys, store and legal steps.
- All artifacts in English. No personal references; always "the user".

## Project state
Phase 0 (foundation) has not started: no Gradle project, no JDK or Android SDK on the machine yet, no CI. Planned stack in `README.md`.

## GitHub
Milestones per phase; issues per change (labels `change`, `spike`, `adr`, `parallelizable`, `blocked`, `needs-human`); public board at https://github.com/users/jdgomez/projects/1. PRs close their issue with `Closes #N`.
